# Notes
### GCP Cloud Concepts
- Services can generally be broken into four categories
    - Compute
    - Storage
    - Big Data
    - Machine Learning
- Compute Engine is a VM
### Intro to GCP
- GCP Foundations
    - Launched in 2008
    - Edge locations can act as a sort of CDN
- Identity Access Management
    - IAM documents any activity on the account
    - `Organizations` are the root of the hierarchy, kinda like an Azure account
    - `Folders` act like subscriptions in Azure
    - `Projects` are like resource groups
- Networking
    - VPC, routes, and firewall rules are global resources
    - Subnets are regional
    - You do get a default network and subnets created for you
    - The GUI config will actually give you a copy of the CLI version of what you configured
- Compute Engine Instance
    - Custom OS options are available
    - Tags are also known as simply `metadata`
    - There are four different types
        - `E` is for general purpose
        - `M` is for memory optimize
        - `N` is General purpose, but balanced price / performance
        - `C` is for compute
- Cloud Storage
    - Bucket names are globally unique
    - There are various classes based on the need for access and availability
        - `Storage` for frequent access and short live
        - `Nearline` for infrequently accessed data
        - `Coldline` is best for disaster recovery
        - `Archive`
    - Autoclass is an option for per object classification
        - Once you go to a standard class, you can't go back
- Database Services
    - Relational:
        - Cloud SQL
            - MySQL
            - PostgreSQL
            - SQL Server
        - Cloud Spanner is globally distributed
    - Non-relational
        - Big table
        - Firestore is fully managed
        - Memory Store is in-memory
- Big Data and Messaging
    - Big Query is a data warehouse
    - Google Dataflow is a managed Apache Beam pipeline for data processing
    - Pub/Sub is a fully managed messaging service
        - You could use this as a sort of Azure Function type automation
- Advanced Major Services
    - Understanding Security
        - Data is encrypted in transit and in rest
    - How are resources monitored?
        - Cloud Monitoring is their version of Azure Monitor
