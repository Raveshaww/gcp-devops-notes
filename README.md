### GCP Cloud Concepts
- Services can generally be broken into four categories
    - Compute
    - Storage
    - Big Data
    - Machine Learning
- Compute Engine is a VM
### Intro to GCP
- GCP Foundations
    - Launched in 2008
    - Edge locations can act as a sort of CDN
- Identity Access Management
    - IAM documents any activity on the account
    - `Organizations` are the root of the hierarchy, kinda like an Azure account
    - `Folders` act like subscriptions in Azure
    - `Projects` are like resource groups
- Networking
    - VPC, routes, and firewall rules are global resources
    - Subnets are regional
    - You do get a default network and subnets created for you
    - The GUI config will actually give you a copy of the CLI version of what you configured
- Compute Engine Instance
    - Custom OS options are available
    - Tags are also known as simply `metadata`
    - There are four different types
        - `E` is for general purpose
        - `M` is for memory optimize
        - `N` is General purpose, but balanced price / performance
        - `C` is for compute
- Cloud Storage
    - Bucket names are globally unique
    - There are various classes based on the need for access and availability
        - `Storage` for frequent access and short live
        - `Nearline` for infrequently accessed data
        - `Coldline` is best for disaster recovery
        - `Archive`
    - Autoclass is an option for per object classification
        - Once you go to a standard class, you can't go back
- Database Services
    - Relational:
        - Cloud SQL
            - MySQL
            - PostgreSQL
            - SQL Server
        - Cloud Spanner is globally distributed
    - Non-relational
        - Big table
        - Firestore is fully managed
        - Memory Store is in-memory
- Big Data and Messaging
    - Big Query is a data warehouse
    - Google Dataflow is a managed Apache Beam pipeline for data processing
    - Pub/Sub is a fully managed messaging service
        - You could use this as a sort of Azure Function type automation
- Advanced Major Services
    - Understanding Security
        - Data is encrypted in transit and in rest
    - How are resources monitored?
        - Cloud Monitoring is their version of Azure Monitor
### Cost Control on GCP
- Billing Organization
    - Billing accounts are also under the Organization layer
    - You can have multiple billing account
    - A single billing account can be associated with multiple projects
    - Projects need a billing account to even create billable resources
- Cost Visibility and Analysis
    - You can export billing data to BigQuery, but soon you will not be able to export this to Cloud Storage soon
- Reducing Costs on GCP
    - Many tools to help reduce costs are automatically implemented
    - Rightsizing recommendations will be made
    - Long running compute are automatically discounted
        - Does not stack with committed discounts
    - Preemptible VM (aka spot instances)
        - Max life of 24 hours regardless
### GCP Essentials
- Working with GCP
    - `Google Cloud Marketplace` is GCP's market place
    - Most things are billed per second
    - `Stack Driver` is GCP's integrated monitor and logging platform (Is this the final name?)
- Running Apps with Compute
    - App Engine is PaaS (basically Azure Service with some more features built in)
        - Auto scaling and auto load balancing
        - Standard env is more proprietary with limited language support, but a faster spin-up time and less expensive
        - Flexible env is based on docker
        - Blob store is legacy
        - Code scanning
    - GKE
        - Load balancing is integrated
        - node pools are supported
        - Auto scale for clusters and nodes
        - Auto upgrades
        - Auto repair
        - Auto logging and monitoring
    - Cloud Functions (basically azure functions)
        - Serverless
    - Managing Storage and Databases
        - `gsutil` stands for `google storage utility`
        - `Cloud Datastore` is NoSQL 
        - `Cloud Bigtable` is a fully managed massively scalable NoSql database
            - Considered a wide column database, instead of a document database
            - No SQL-like language is available
            - single key per row
### Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer
- Intro to GCP
    - GCP's three pillars are
        - Trust and Security
            - Secure by design
        - Open Cloud
            - Open source
        - Analytics and AI
    - Networking is divided into three layers
        - VPC
        - Routers
        - Subnets
    - Security
        - Data at rest is chunked, encrypted, and stored across a range of servers
    - Database
        - Firestore is NoSQL
        - Firebase lets you store and sync data for your users in real time
    - Cloud shell
        - 5gb of storage
- Cloud Storage
    - Cloud Firestore is separate
        - Fully managed NFS
    - Disks
        - Zonal is the default offered for VMs
        - Regional Persistent Disk
            - Replicated across two zones
        - Local SSD
- Compute Engine and VPC
    - Accelerator optimized is for high performance workloads like parallel computing and API
    - Managed instance group is a collection of VMs that you can manage as a single entity (tldr vm scaleset)
    - Snapshots seem to be the fastest way to "clone" an instance, and can be used to create a VM image
    - You are allowed to bring your IPs
    - Share VPC allows you to use one VPC with multiple projects
- Kubernetes
    - GKE
        - It's the open source K8S platform under the hood
        - Consists of compute engine machines to create a cluster
        - Broken into two things
            - control plane
                - manages worker nodes
                - consists of
                    - api server
                    - etcd
                    - scheduler (also monitors)
                    - control managers
            - nodes
                - A cluster is a group of one or nodes
                - Nodes run one or more pods
                    - Each node gets a cidr range
                - pods consist of
                    - container run time
                    - kubelet to ensure stuff is running
                    - kubeproxy for networking
                    - each pod has its own IP address
                - Kubectl lets you run commands against the cluster
- Cloud Functions
    - CLoud run can deploy containers (kinda like function app but with containers)
- GCP Monitoring and Logging Services
    - `cloud ops` is the name of the agent you install on VMs
- Big Data Resources
    - cloud dataproc is a managed Hadoop / mapreduce, etc
    - datalab enables interactive data exploration
